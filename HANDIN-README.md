# CS56 Web Application: StoreMapper

## Introduction


### Project Overview
StoreMapper is a web-based application desgined to manage and visualize location data, primarily focusing on stores and restaurants. It uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) data structures for its mapping and routing features, such as:
* Interactive map interface using Leaflet.js
* Location search and filtering based on OSM tags
* Shortest and fastest path routing between locations using Djikstra's algorithm

### Key Features and Achievements
1. OSM Data Integration
2. Advanced Routing Algorithms
3. Interactive UI
4. Scalable Architecture
5. Efficient Data Handling
6. Comprehensive Testing
7. Cross-Environment Compatibility
8. Performance Optimization
