# Contributing to StoreMapper

Welcome to the StoreMapper project! As fellow students in this advanced Java class, we're all in this together. This guide will help us collaborate effectively and learn from each other throughout the project.

## Project Overview

StoreMapper is our class project aimed at creating a web application for locating and managing information about various types of locations. We're using Java, Jakarta EE, and other technologies to build this application.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the development environment as described in the README.md file.
3. Familiarize yourself with the project structure and existing code.

## How We Work Together

### Communication

- Use our agreed-upon communication channels (e.g., Discord) to stay in touch.
- Share your progress, challenges, and ideas openly with the team.
- Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek help from your classmates.

### Contributing Code

1. Before starting on a new feature or fix, discuss it with the team.
2. Create a new branch for your work.
3. Write clear, commented code following the project's coding standards.
4. Test your changes thoroughly.
5. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages.
6. Push your changes and open a pull request for review.

### Code Reviews

- We'll review each other's code to learn and improve together.
- Be constructive and respectful in your feedback.
- Use code reviews as an opportunity to share knowledge and learn new techniques.

### Learning Together

- If you're strong in an area, offer to help others who might be struggling.
- If you're finding something challenging, don't hesitate to ask for help or clarification.
- Consider pair programming for complex features or to share knowledge.

## Project Structure

Familiarize yourself with the key areas of our project:

- `src/main/java`: Java source files
- `src/main/webapp`: Web resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- `src/test`: Test files

## Coding Standards

- Follow Java Code Conventions for Java files.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation in Java files.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features or bug fixes when possible.
- Run existing tests before submitting your changes to ensure nothing breaks.

## Documentation

- Update the README.md if you make changes that affect project setup or usage.
- Document new features or significant changes in the appropriate places.

## Resolving Conflicts

If we have differing opinions on implementation:
1. Discuss the options openly and respectfully.
2. Consider the pros and cons of each approach.
3. If we can't reach a consensus, we'll consult our instructor for guidance.

Remember, we're all here to learn and grow as developers. Let's support each other and make this project a great learning experience for everyone!
